            <p> Hi, my name is Harshika I live in California and study in 6th grade, and I really like to paint. 
                
                Some of the reasons I like to paint is because painting makes me feel calm and energetic, it gives me solutions to problems that I am finding trouble to solve, and especially I really like all the different shades of colors and how if we mix two colors there is a new one formed. 
                
                It also gives me inspiration about certain topics, painting is a way of expressing our emotions too, in different ways. To conclude painting has been a great thing to do in the winter break. </p>
